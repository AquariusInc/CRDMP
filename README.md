## Setting up Django
Should be as easy as install python 3, cloning the git repo running, opening the repo and running ```pip install -r requirements.txt```, then running ```python manage.py runserver```. I would also recommend setting up a [virtalenv](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/) to contain the python environment, this makes sure that everything is the right version and that its in the same state as the server and other people's machines.
